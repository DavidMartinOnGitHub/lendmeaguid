# Lend Me a GUID

Lend Me a GUID is a simple GUID Generator Web API. The WebAPI uses ASP Core
and exposes a __/guid__ route. If you use an HTTP GET then one guid is returned
otherwise POST to /guid using a JSON Body to provide generation options.

The WebAPI uses Swagger at the /swagger/index.html route. 
There is a basic website at /index.html that allows setting options when GUIDs are
requested.
